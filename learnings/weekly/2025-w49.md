# Week 49 Summary (Nov 30 - Dec 6, 2025)

## This Week's Theme
**From failure to framework**: A force-push mistake became the foundation for a comprehensive multi-agent workflow with voice notifications.

## Top Learnings

1. **Safety rules are infrastructure, not guidelines** (001-force-push)
   - Reading rules isn't enough—they must be internalized
   - Treat coordination rules like industrial safety procedures

2. **Distill complexity into memorable principles** (002-golden-rule)
   - The Golden Rule: 4 principles covering all safety cases
   - Complete, memorable, actionable

3. **Upstream issues over local patches** (003-upstream-first)
   - Document for the community, avoid maintenance debt
   - Knowledge sharing > quick fixes

## Intentions vs Outcomes

| Intended | Actual | Delta |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Sync agent branches | Destroyed histories (force-push) | Created safety documentation |
| Simple notifications | Voice system with unique agents | Exceeded scope positively |
| Quick MAW setup | 7-day comprehensive workflow | More thorough than planned |
| Fix OSC bug locally | Upstream issue #26 | Better long-term approach |

## Timeline

| Date | Phase | Key Event |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Nov 30 | Foundation | MAW setup, **force-push incident** |
| Dec 1 AM | Safety | Golden Rule, SYNC-RULES.md (450 lines) |
| Dec 1 PM | Testing | Smart sync validation, OSC bug → issue #26 |
| Dec 2 | Notifications | Hooks, path-based agent ID, speech queue |
| Dec 4-5 | Voice | macOS voices, TOML config, per-agent rates |
| Dec 6 | Polish | Documentation, subagent research |

## Artifacts Created

- **Documentation**: 9 retrospectives, DEVELOPMENT-REPORT.md, SYNC-RULES.md
- **Scripts**: smart-sync.sh, agent-*-notify.sh, speech queue
- **Config**: agent-voices.toml with 4 unique voices
- **Hooks**: SessionStart, Stop, SubagentStop notifications

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Retrospectives | 9 |
| Commits | 30+ |
| Slash commands | 17+ |
| Scripts | 6 |
| Voices configured | 4 |

## Carry Forward

1. **The Golden Rule** works—keep using it as safety checklist
2. **Path-based agent ID** is reliable—no counters needed
3. **TOML config** makes voice settings maintainable
4. **Background subagents** enable async research without blocking

## Quote of the Week

> "The system works not because it was perfectly designed from the start, but because each iteration learned from the last. Each failure became a feature. Each correction became documentation."
