# Massive Learning Session

**Time**: 11:26 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~1 hour
**Commits**: 15

## What We Learned

### 1. Reference-Based Cleanup
- **Check refs before closing** - grep ψ-retrospectives/, ψ-learnings/, ψ-logs/, git log
- **Decision matrix**: 0 refs = close, 1-2 = review, 3+ = keep
- Prevented 4 bad closes, found 15 truly orphaned issues

### 2. Model Attribution
- Different models for different tasks: Sonnet for planning, Haiku for fast ops
- Attribution format: `🤖 **Claude [Model]** (agent-name)`
- Makes it clear who did what in collaborative AI work

### 3. Subagent Limitations
- Haiku agents **cannot spawn other agents** → embed logic instead
- jq `startswith()` fails with emoji → use `test()` regex
- GitHub auto-links `#N` but full URLs work in local markdown

### 4. Events Log Pattern
- Daily log: `ψ-logs/YYYY-MM/DD/events.md`
- Append-only, tracks all actions with timestamps
- Enables "what happened on date X?" queries

### 5. Snapshot vs Context Issue
- `/snapshot` = knowledge capture (local only, descriptive filename)
- `ccc` = GitHub context issue (for handoff/tracking)
- Different purposes, complementary tools

## How Things Connect

- **context-finder → issues-cleanup**: Cleanup uses context-finder's search patterns
- **events.md → learnings**: Events capture actions, learnings distill patterns
- **Model attribution → trust**: Knowing which model did what builds understanding
- **Reference checking → safety**: Consult before acting prevents mistakes
- **Sonnet for plans → Haiku for execution**: Right model for right task

## Key Discoveries

| Discovery | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| 0 refs = truly orphaned | Safe cleanup decisions |
| Embed logic vs spawn agents | Work around Haiku limitations |
| GitHub links in local markdown | Clickable everywhere |
| Model-specific roles | Better task allocation |
| Test → refine → score loop | Iterative improvement works |

## Raw Thoughts

- The test → refine → score pattern is powerful for subagent development
- Model attribution could extend to commits (Co-Authored-By already does this)
- Events log is becoming the "source of truth" for session history
- Pattern "consult before acting" is a universal safety principle
- Sonnet plans are noticeably better than Haiku plans
- Could add model to commit messages: `🤖 Haiku` vs `🤖 Sonnet`
- The ψ-* directories are becoming a real knowledge system
