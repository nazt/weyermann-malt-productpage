## What Happened
- Created issues-cleanup subagent (follows archiver pattern)
- Renamed nnn → new-feature subagent
- Iterated on Related format: `#N (YYYY-MM-DD)` sorted by issue number
- Tested new-feature subagent - format verified correct
- Created plan issue #58 for /snapshot command
- Removed useless token tracking (haiku can't self-report accurately)

## Quick Notes
- Haiku can't count its own tokens accurately (30.9k actual vs ~2k reported)
- Related format evolution: titles → no titles → date first → back to #N (date) sorted
- new-feature subagent now works with correct format
- Plan agent (built-in) vs new-feature (custom) - different tools

## Files Touched
```
.claude/agents/issues-cleanup.md (new)
.claude/agents/new-feature.md (renamed from nnn.md, iterated)
CLAUDE.md (added subagents)
```

## Raw Thoughts
- /snapshot should combine ccc + knowledge-save - pending issue #58
- Format standards are important for consistency and searchability
- Subagent patterns: archiver for files, issues-cleanup for GitHub issues
- Token tracking was a dead end - haiku can't observe its own usage
