# MAW Subagent Self-Improvement

**Time**: 19:33 GMT+7

## What We Learned

- **Delegate research to subagents** - Main agent shouldn't read code directly; use context-finder to gather information
- **Simpler is faster** - Over-engineered pane detection (49s, 16.7k tokens) vs simple start-verify (much faster)
- **Profile matters** - profile0 (1 window, 3 panes) vs profile14 (2 windows, 6 panes) - wrong default caused wrong output
- **Iterative self-improvement works** - Agent can update its own definition file and test until correct

## How Things Connect

- **context-finder + maw**: Use context-finder to research profile configs, then update maw.md based on findings
- **profile14 + six-horizontal-2win**: Profile name maps to layout type in start-agents.sh
- **Subagent definition + behavior**: What's in .claude/agents/maw.md directly controls what haiku does when spawned

## Key Discoveries

- **Token cost of complexity**: 16.7k tokens for a startup task = bad design
- **Kill-start pattern**: Simpler to kill existing session and start fresh than detect and preserve
- **Pane mapping**: Window 0 has agents 1-3, Window 1 has agents 4-6 (useful for maw send)

## Anti-Patterns Avoided

- Reading code directly when subagent could do it
- Complex pane state detection when simple restart works
- Using wrong profile and getting wrong results

## Commits

- `pending` - maw.md update to use profile14 and simplify

## Raw Thoughts

The pattern here is powerful: main agent orchestrates, subagents execute research and actions. When something is slow or wrong, the main agent can:
1. Use context-finder to understand the problem
2. Update the subagent definition
3. Test the subagent
4. Iterate until correct

This is meta-learning - the system improving itself.
