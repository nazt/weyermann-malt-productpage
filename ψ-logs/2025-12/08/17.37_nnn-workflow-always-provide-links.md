# nnn Workflow: Always Provide Links

**Time**: 17:37 GMT+7

## What We Learned
- When `nnn` creates a GitHub issue via new-feature agent, **always provide the full URL**
- User expectation: issue number alone is not enough - need clickable link
- The new-feature agent reports success but link must be surfaced to user

## How Things Connect
- `nnn` workflow chain: context-finder (haiku) → Plan (haiku) → new-feature (sonnet)
- new-feature agent creates issue via `gh issue create`
- Agent returns issue number but **main agent must fetch and display URL**
- Use `gh issue view N --json url --jq '.url'` to get link

## Key Discoveries
- Subagent output != user-facing output
- Main agent responsible for presenting results with proper links
- User feedback: "always give me the links" - direct, clear expectation

## Workflow Fix
After new-feature creates issue, always run:
```bash
gh issue view [NUMBER] --json url --jq '.url'
```
Then present: `**Issue #N**: [full URL]`

## Tags
`nnn` `workflow` `new-feature` `ux` `links` `user-feedback`

## Raw Thoughts
- Should this be baked into new-feature agent itself?
- Or is it main agent's job to present results?
- Either way: user sees number, wants link. Always provide both.
