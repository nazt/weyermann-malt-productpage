# The ψ (Psi) Naming Convention

**Date**: 2025-12-06
**Source**: This session

## Intent
Find a meaningful prefix to group knowledge directories at the bottom of the file tree.

## Outcome
Chose ψ (psi) - the Greek letter representing mind and soul.

## Gap Analysis
No gap - the outcome exceeded intent. What started as a sorting problem became a meaningful naming convention.

## Key Learning
**Naming matters. A good name transforms a technical decision into something memorable and meaningful. ψ (psi) isn't just a prefix - it's a statement about what these directories contain: the mind and soul of the project.**

## Structure
```
ψ-docs/           # Technical documentation (mind)
ψ-learnings/      # Distilled wisdom (soul)
ψ-retrospectives/ # Session memories (psyche)
```

## Applied In
- Renamed docs/ → ψ-docs/
- Renamed learnings/ → ψ-learnings/
- Renamed retrospectives/ → ψ-retrospectives/

## Why ψ?
- Greek letter for "psyche" (mind/soul)
- Visually distinctive
- Sorts near bottom of file tree
- Meaningful symbolism for knowledge repositories
