# Learnings

Meta-summaries capturing the essence of "what we did vs what we wanted."

## Purpose

This directory distills wisdom from retrospectives into actionable insights:
- **Intentions**: What we wanted to achieve
- **Outcomes**: What actually happened
- **Gaps**: Where intentions differed from outcomes
- **Patterns**: Recurring themes across sessions

## Philosophy

> "Each failure became a feature. Each correction became documentation."

Learnings are not just records—they're institutional memory that prevents repeating mistakes and accelerates future work.
