## Session Summary

Workshop demo session. Rewrote README.md to focus on MAW, subagents, and voice system instead of product page. Removed old specs directory. Analyzed 20+ retrospectives and presented findings to workshop participants. Fixed maw-orchestrator subagent that wasn't being recognized (missing YAML frontmatter).

## 📝 AI Diary (REQUIRED - min 150 words)

🤔 I assumed the maw-orchestrator wasn't working because of some complex configuration issue. But when I compared it with working subagents like thai-translator, I discovered it was simply missing the YAML frontmatter block at the top. The `---` delimiters and fields (name, description, tools, model) are required for Claude Code to recognize a file as a subagent. This taught me to always check the basics first - format and structure - before assuming complex problems.

😕 I was confused when the user asked about voice notifications "not working" and then immediately pivoted to starting MAW. The context shift was abrupt. The confusion cleared when I realized these were separate issues - the notifications may have a bug, but the immediate need was to demo MAW for the workshop. The mental shift was understanding that in a live demo context, "good enough now" beats "perfect later."

😮 I expected the retrospective analysis to be a quick summary, but looking at 20+ retrospectives revealed a compelling narrative arc: from force-push disaster (Nov 30) through Golden Rule creation (Dec 1) to self-improving subagents (Dec 6). The surprise was seeing how coherent the week's work was when viewed as a whole - each session built on the previous, and mistakes consistently became features.

## What Went Well

- **Quick diagnosis** → Found frontmatter issue by comparing files → Fixed in minutes
- **Thai summary** → Provided clear workshop explanation → User could present immediately
- **Retrospective analysis** → Comprehensive review of 20+ sessions → Clear narrative arc

## What Could Improve

- Should have checked subagent format earlier when first error appeared
- Could have asked user to clarify "notifications not working" before investigating

## Blockers & Resolutions

- **Blocker**: maw-orchestrator not recognized as subagent
  **Resolution**: Added missing YAML frontmatter (---) block

- **Blocker**: Claude Code caches subagents at startup
  **Resolution**: File was modified externally, subagent reloaded

## 💭 Honest Feedback (REQUIRED - min 100 words)

🔴 **What DIDN'T work**: The notification debugging got interrupted. User said "nothing happened" but we never actually diagnosed why. I started checking the scripts and settings.json but got redirected to MAW startup. The actual notification bug remains unfixed - we just moved on.

🟡 **What was FRUSTRATING**: The rapid context switches during the demo. Product summary → Thai explanation → retrospective analysis → notifications → MAW startup → subagent fix. Each pivot was reasonable but made it hard to complete any investigation fully.

🟢 **What DELIGHTED me**: The maw-orchestrator working after the fix! Seeing it detect "3/3 agents already running" and correctly skip spawning was satisfying. The subagent did exactly what it was designed to do - detect before act.

| Contribution | Human | AI | Together |
|--------------|-------|-----|----------|
| Direction/Vision | ✓ | | |
| Options/Alternatives | | ✓ | |
| Final Decision | ✓ | | |
| Execution | | ✓ | |
| Meaning/Naming | | | ✓ |

## ✨ Resonance Moments

- "อยากให้บอกว่าเราทำอะไรกัน" → Created Thai summary → Clear workshop presentation
- "make the maw-orchestrator working" → Found frontmatter issue → Simple fix, big impact

## 🎯 Intent vs Interpretation

| You Said | I Understood | Gap? | Impact |
|----------|--------------|------|--------|
| "summarize all code" | Read everything, rewrite README | ✓ | |
| "remove all specs" | Delete specs/ directory | ✓ | |
| "notifications not working" | Debug notification system | ⚠️ | Got redirected before fixing |
| "make maw-orchestrator working" | Fix whatever's broken | ✓ | |

**ADVERSARIAL CHECK**:
1. **Unverified assumption**: "I assumed the notification issue needed deep debugging without asking what 'not working' meant specifically"
2. **Near-miss**: "I almost started a long investigation into hooks when user just wanted to move to MAW demo"
3. **Over-confidence**: "I was too sure the frontmatter fix would require Claude Code restart - it didn't"

## 💬 Communication Dynamics (REQUIRED)

### Clarity
| Direction | Clear? | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| You → Me | Good | "make the maw-orchestrator working" - clear goal |
| Me → You | Good | Thai summary was well-received for workshop |

### Feedback Loop
- **Speed**: Fast - user interrupted when needed to pivot
- **Recovery**: Good - adapted to each new direction
- **Pattern**: Demo mode = rapid pivots, keep moving

### Trust & Initiative
- **Trust level**: Right - let me explore, redirected when needed
- **Proactivity**: Balanced - tried to complete tasks but followed redirects
- **Assumptions**: Should have asked more about notification issue

### What Would Make Next Session Better?
- **You could**: Clarify which issue is priority when multiple arise
- **I could**: Ask "investigate or move on?" when interrupted
- **We could**: Have a "demo mode" signal for rapid-fire tasks

## 🌱 Seeds Planted

- 🌱 **Incremental**: Debug notification hooks properly → **Trigger**: use when demo is over
- 🌿 **Transformative**: Auto-validate subagent YAML on save → **Trigger**: use when creating new subagents
- 🌳 **Moonshot**: Subagent hot-reload without Claude Code restart → **Trigger**: use when developing subagents frequently

## 📚 Teaching Moments

- **You → Me**: "Workshop mode needs quick pivots" — discovered when user rapidly changed topics — matters because context is different from deep work
- **Me → You**: "Subagents need YAML frontmatter" — discovered when comparing working vs broken — matters because it's easy to miss
- **Us → Future**: "Check the basics first" — created fix in 2 minutes — use when debugging any config issue

## Lessons Learned

- **Pattern**: Compare working vs broken config files - differences reveal issues
- **Mistake**: Didn't ask for clarification on "not working" before investigating
- **Discovery**: Claude Code can reload subagents without full restart (via external file modification)

## Next Steps

- [ ] Debug notification hooks properly (why "nothing happened")
- [ ] Test voice notifications end-to-end
- [ ] Document subagent YAML format requirements
